### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 3rd year Finance major student at the Univeristy of Melbourne. 

Aside from school, I like to learn programming as a hobby. From time to time, I would get inspired to use my programming knowledge to create a project that is related to my field of study. 

Check out my latest project: https://github.com/longsondt/Discounted-Free-Cash-Flow-method-for-stock-valuation
